Digital Transactions & Demographics Analysis
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project analyzes digital transaction patterns across Indian states and correlates them with demographic data to derive actionable insights. The analysis focuses on understanding trends in transactions, user adoption, app activity, and population/density factors that influence digital payments.

The primary objective is to provide a data-driven understanding of where digital adoption is strong or weak, and suggest strategies for improvement.

ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries

Python: Data manipulation and visualization

Pandas: Data cleaning and aggregation

Matplotlib & Seaborn: Visualizations (line charts, scatter plots, bar charts, heatmaps)

ðŸ“Š Analyses Performed

Transaction Trends

Quarterly and yearly trends of transactions per state

Average transaction value (ATV) analysis

Insights on seasonal effects or anomalies

Demographics Correlation

Correlated state population and density with transaction volume, registered users, and app opens

Generated scatter plots with regression lines

Correlation heatmaps for easy interpretation

Actionable Insights

Identified high-potential states for user acquisition

Suggested interventions for dense states with low digital adoption

Highlighted trends in transaction value for targeted campaigns

âš¡ Key Insights

Population is the strongest driver of digital adoption.

High-density states do not always correlate with higher transactions, suggesting other behavioral or infrastructure factors.

Registered users strongly correlate with population (r â‰ˆ 0.86).

App usage shows moderate correlation with density (r â‰ˆ 0.36).

Actionable recommendations include targeted user acquisition, promoting higher-value transactions, and improving digital literacy in low-adoption regions.
